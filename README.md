- place `w3strings.exe` in the `/tools` directory
- place your bundles in the `/bundles` directory
- open the `/scripts` directory and:
  - use `open-cmd.bat` if you need a cmd.exe terminal
  - use `release.bat` if you want to create a release-ready directory called `/release`
  - use `encode-csv-strings.bat` if you want to encode the `/strings/en.w3strings.csv` file. The encoded strings will be placed alongside the csv file and will be called `/strings/en.w3strings`
